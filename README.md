# Dynago

External .NET CSGO Cheat which produces unique builds via advanced methods of obfuscation.

Concept:

> Randomize the cheat before compilation with string manipulation and after with managed obfuscation.

Future development:

> Transfer pre-compiling randomization such as variable name randomization to my own custom obfuscation. Use mono/dnlib instead of string manipulation.
